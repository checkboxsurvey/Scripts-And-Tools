# InvitationCreationExample

This sample application (written in C#) is meant to demonstrate a straightforward approach to authoring, editing, adding email contacts, and sending an invitation, all via code.  This sample is meant to be used by a developer, and therefore does not make efforts to nicely parameterize variables.  There is also significant hardcoded data, which you will want to override and parameterize yourself as needed.

This sample runs without issue on a local VM, but no claims are made as to the overall quality or reliability of the code.  It is not advisable to copy-paste this directly into your production code with no alterations.
